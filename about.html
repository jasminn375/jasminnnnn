        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Diane Jasmin B. Broquel, a student based in Our Lady of Fatima University with
            a passion for photography. I've been exploring photography for 2 years and am constantly
            amazed by how a single shot can capture a moment, a feeling, or a story. What started as a
            hobby has quickly turned into a creative outlet, and I'm always learning and experimenting
            with new techniques. Right now, I'm focusing on portrait photography, street photography,
            landscape photography and I'm excited to continue growing and refining my skills in specific
            technique, editing, or camera gear. Photography has taught me to see the world from new
            perspectives, and I can't wait to keep exploring what's possible with my camera.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a student, I'm always pushing myself to think outside the box and experiment with different
            styles and subjects. I'm especially drawn to fashion, architecture, nature photography. Along
            the way, I've also learned the value of patience and practice often finding that the best images
            come after spending time perfecting both technique and composition. Photography has become
            more than just a hobby for meâ€”it's a passion that fuels my creativity and inspires me to keep
            learning and improving.
